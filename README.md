Trying to make it easier to use JEPAs :)

# Introduction
I've been bullish on JEPAs twice; in between, I felt like it was a dead end... It has been the second time when I have truly discovered the value behind them, that it is worth working on it.

There has been a lot of works, some of the works use JEPA but it is not clear that they do so, unless you go deep dive into the paper they present.

The main reason why I felt JEPAs were a bit off, came when I started seeing video an diffusion models being capable of doing edits with the performance they have nowadays. It felt like the capabilities of JEPA models wouldnt get us any closer to how such image and video models were already capable of, without using the JEPA way of training models.

The first "white pill" moment came when I listened to the different interviews given by Lecun; somehow, I also found out that Hierarchical RL and world models werent new; and thus, felt a bit off, and that it was just a new way of doing things in such directions (ahem ahem Schmidhuber :)).

The second "white pill" moment (and possibly the last one I will need) was days ago, when I found out that the VJEPA2 was capable of controlling a Franka Arm, by just watching hours of youtube videos, and then doing a bit of semisupervised learning kind of thing (possibly not semisupervised at all... I am not there yet, still digesting the IJEPA); that felt like a solution to a problem that I was quite curious about solving for the last couple of weeks, and even felt like it would be a great pivot point for DaertML to dedicate the greatest efforts for... Somehow the different approaches that I was considering werent as general and scalable (bitter lesson pilled ;)) as the JEPAs.

And here we are, give 3 or 4 reads to the IJEPA paper, still finding out how to do things from other peoples materials and resources, and with the motivation to work on this until i get to grok the JEPAs and do SSL (Self Supervised Learning) on robotics or other problems in the field.
